title: Manifesto

---
_We believe that understanding users should be approached scientifically._ 

_That our understanding of the user is a tentative explanation of things; it is made of compelling problems and hypothetical solutions for them._ 

_That users are a fluid river of individuals with moving sets of beliefs and desires._ 

_That we can dig deeper and deeper into the structure of reality, discovering new problems and proposing new theoretical solutions for old problems._ 

_We believe that there are universal laws and frameworks, and approaches that will succeed if tried. We believe in our core we are looking to help create trust for a product._ 

_That as scientists we can find solutions._ 

_The difference between science and other ways of doing business is that science adheres to the tradition of evaluating hypothetical explanations critically, which, whenever possible, includes empirical tests._ 

_The method of science is the checking of theories; that is, their critical evaluation and replacement by better candidates, guided by the idea of searching for truth._
