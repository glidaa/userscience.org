Our space Global Experience Language (GEL) is a living, breathing online design framework that enables everyone that gives many options to easily test user experiences at a micro level and discover experiences that delver remarkable user experience.

We are giving you the tool to test different ideas with a design system that gives you a range of components to test and try.

We want space to be a designed with accessibility first, with so many people living with disabilities we feel we need to test for these users and give them great experiences.

Space is built for you to rapidly prototype and test with an inbuilt playroom to quickly test ideas and controls to allow you to bring your colours, brand and spacing and still test options.
