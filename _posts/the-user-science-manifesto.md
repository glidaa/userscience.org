We believe that understanding users should be approached scientifically. That our understanding of the user is a tentative explanation of things; it is made of compelling problems and hypothetical solutions for them. That users are a fluid river of individuals with moving set up beliefs and desires.That we can dig deeper and deeper into the structure of reality, discovering new problems and proposing new theoretical solutions for old problems. We believe there are universal laws and frameworks, and approaches that will succeed if tried. We believe in our core we are looking to help create trust for a product. That as scientists we can find solutions. The difference between science and other ways of doing business is science adheres to the tradition of evaluating hypothetical explanations critically, which, whenever possible, includes empirical tests.  The method of science is the checking of theories; that is, their critical evaluation and replacement by better candidates, guided by the idea of searching for truth.
