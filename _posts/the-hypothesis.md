The first step for becoming a user scientist is the problem statement, from here you establish what you are looking to solve, with the parameters of what is efficient. The next step is to collect data in all forms, then make a hypothesis and then test.

Distinctive problem solving begins with rigorous definition of the client problem and of how we will create and deliver “only McKinsey”-level client impact. Sometimes it is tempting to skip this step because we believe we know the solution to the problem; or we believe we

have clearly defined the problem in our letter of proposal; or our clients push us to move on, believing that they have already defined the problem sufficiently. Any of these may be true; however, many “bad” engagements are rooted in a lack of common understanding of success. Good problem solvers take time, before doing anything else, to establish a precise, comprehensive, well-articulated definition of the real problem that needs to be solved, and to ensure that this definition is understood and agreed upon by all the appropriate people at the client and by all team members.
